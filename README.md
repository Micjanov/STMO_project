Physarum polycephalum, an acellular slime mold, is well known for its problem-solving abilities. In this notebook, we explore the Slime Mold Algorithm (SMA) which attempts to replicate this organism's special properties and use it to solve a wider array of problems. We will first look at the biological background and then explore the mathematical background of the algorithm. We will then investigate its performance and compare it to modified versions of the algorithm. Finally, we will apply this algorithm to some interesting usecases.
